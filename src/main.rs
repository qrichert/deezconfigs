What does {package} do?
  The core of {package} is to replicate the file structure of a given
  directory (i.e., the config root), inside the Home. The main purpose
  of this is to keep all the config files in one place, making it easy
  to version them.

  {package} is very un-opinionated by default. It tries to do its job
  well (syncing config files), while avoiding to do what other tools do
  better. For instance, there is no automatic versioning, no embedded
  text editor, and no templating. You absolutely _can_ do all of the
  above, but it's not something that's forced on you. It's _your_
  processes, _your_ tools. All the extensibility power lies in hooks
  (read further below).

Copying vs. Linking:
  {package} supports two configuration models: copying and linking.
  Both models come with different trade-offs. For instance, linking
  ensures files are always up-to-date, but on the flip-side, you can't
  really have machine specific configuration. On the other hand, copying
  files need to be kept up-to-date manually by `sync`ing or `rsync`ing
  all changes. But, having separate copies makes it easier to keep
  configuration generic in the root, and specific in the Home.

The Config Root:
  As mentioned before, the config root is any directory whose structure
  you want to replicate in the Home directory.

  That said, you _should_, but are not required to, create a `.deez`
  file in the root. This lets {package} know it is safe to use. If
  {package} doesn't find a `.deez` file, it will ask you confirmation
  before modifying you file system. This is a security feature to
  prevent you from accidentally messing up your Home if you run `{bin}`
  from the wrong directory.

  Another advantage of creating a proper root is that that it lets you
  run `{bin}` inside sub-directories as well. Just like you can run Git
  commands from anywhere in the repo, {package} is smart enough to
  search for a root in parent directories before warning you that the
  current directory is not a root.

Home:
  This is the directory where config files are copied or symlinked to.
  On Unix, this is read from the `HOME` environment variable, and on
  Windows from `USERPROFILE`.

  Using a different Home is not natively supported by an argumment, but
  you can override the environment variable to achieve what you want.

      {highlight}${reset} HOME=/home/other {bin} sync

Sync:
  Syncing in {package} replicates the file structure from the config
  root inside the Home directory (minus ignored files).

      {attenuate}# Sync current config root.{reset}
      {highlight}${reset} {bin} sync

      {attenuate}# Sync given config root, verbosely.{reset}
      {highlight}${reset} {bin} --verbose sync ~/configs

      {attenuate}# Sync from remote.{reset}
      {highlight}${reset} {bin} sync git:https://github.com/qrichert/configs

rSync:
  Reverse-syncing is the complimentary opposite of syncing: it updates
  your config files in the root with the current content from Home.

      {attenuate}# 1. Sync your config file to your Home.{reset}
      {highlight}${reset} {bin} sync

      {attenuate}# 2. Make some changes.{reset}
      {highlight}${reset} vim ~/.gitconfig

      {attenuate}# 3. rSync the changes back into your root.{reset}
      {highlight}${reset} {bin} rsync

Link:
  Linking is the same as syncing, but it creates symbolic links in the
  Home instead of copying files. Linking has no `rsync` equivalent
  because linked files are always up-to-date.

      {attenuate}# Symlink current config root.{reset}
      {highlight}${reset} {bin} link

Status:
  Status prints the list of configuration files with their respective
  state of 'syncness', and also prints your hooks.

  Configuration files can be:

      {in_sync}  In Sync
      {modified}  Modified
      {missing}  Missing

Diff:
  Diffing prints the line-diff between your config root and your Home.
  This shows you exactly what has changed and where. There is not merge
  feature however, as merging is best done by your VCS.

Clean:
  Cleaning is removing all the files and symlinks from the Home.

      {attenuate}# 1. Link your files to your Home.{reset}
      {highlight}${reset} {bin} link

      {attenuate}# 2. Now remove all the links you've just created.{reset}
      {highlight}${reset} {bin} clean

Ignore some files:
  By default, {package} ignores all the hook files (at the root) the
  `.git` directory at the root (if any), all `.ignore` and `.gitignore`
  files, and all `.deez` files, wherever they are (enabling multi-root
  repos).

  You can extend this list by adding entries to your `.ignore` and/or
  `.gitignore` files, they are both respected by {package}.

  If you want to both version a file in Git and have it ignored by
  {package}, you can either add it to a `.gitignore` and `git add -f`
  it, or you can use a generic `.ignore` file instead.

Hooks:
  {package} let you run hooks before and after commands. Hooks are
  scripts or executables located at the root and whose names match the
  following pattern:

      (pre|post)-<command>[.extension]

  A common example would be...

      post-sync.sh

  ...a shell script that gets run after every `{bin} sync` command.

  You can have multiple hooks for the same action; they will be run in
  name order (`post-sync.001.sh`, then `post-sync.002.sh`, etc.).

  Hooks are executed through `sh`. It is roughly equivalent to:

      {highlight}${reset} cd <root>
      {highlight}${reset} export DEEZ_...  {attenuate}# {bin} envionrment variables.{reset}
      {highlight}${reset} sh -c \"<root>/<hook>\"

  Note that you'll likely want the scripts to start with a shebang
  (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env python3`).

  As an example, here are two complimentary scripts that respectively
  set and unset Git's email address in the `.gitconfig` file when you
  `sync` and `rsync` it:

      {highlight}${reset} cat post-sync.sh
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      [[ -n $DEEZ_VERBOSE ]] && echo \"Set global Git email address.\"
      git config --global user.email your.email@example.com

      {highlight}${reset} cat post-rsync.sh
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      [[ -n $DEEZ_VERBOSE ]] && echo \"Unset Git email address.\"
      git config --file ./.gitconfig user.email '<>'

  They both make use of the `DEEZ_VERBOSE` environment variable to
  enrich the output of `{bin}` in verbose mode.

  {package} passes a few envionrment variables to hooks to make your
  life easier:

  - `DEEZ_ROOT` Absolute path to the config Root. This is equal to `pwd`
    on Unix systems, since hooks are run in the root.
  - `DEEZ_HOME` Absolute path to the Home directory. This is equal to
    `$HOME` on Unix systems.
  - `DEEZ_VERBOSE` Will be `true` if run in verbose mode, otherwise it
    will be unset (hint: use `[[ -n $DEEZ_VERBOSE ]]` to test for
    existance).
  - `DEEZ_OS` Contains the name of the current operating system (e.g,
    `linux`, `macos`, `windows`, etc.). The name is a re-export of
    Rust's `std::consts::OS`.

Templating:
  There is no built-in templating in {package}, but you can implement
  simple to very tailored templating with hooks. From simple `sed`
  commands, to something way more advanced like Jinja2 in Python.

Copy some files, and link others:
  Use mutliple roots. You can have multiple roots (subdirectories) in
  one repo. Use `sync` in one, and `link` in the other.

  If you need anything more advanced than that, `deezconfigs` is likely
  not the right tool for you.
